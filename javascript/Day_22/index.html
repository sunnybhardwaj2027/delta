    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>
    <p id="description">
        In 1962. with the sucess of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage deemand for comic books and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As with Fantstic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an oppurtunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books. In his autobiography Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp megazine crime fighter the spider as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall-adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or no this is true.
